1. Adding Necessary Libraries: ✓
Importing the required libraries for TensorFlow model building, data manipulation, and visualization should come first.

2. Configuring Directories and Paths for Datasets: ✅
Establish the categories for the different types of brain tumors and specify the training/testing folders and dataset path.

3. Preprocessing and loading the dataset: ✅
Create a DataFrame to store image data, view the distribution of tumor kinds, and read images from each category in the training directory.

4. Seeing Pictures of Every Type of Tumor: ✅
Show a grid of subplots with sample photos for every type of tumor.

5. Configuring Image Size, Batch Size, and Epochs: ✅ Establish the size of the image, the training batch size, and the number of training epochs.

6. Data Preprocessing and Augmentation: ✅ Use methods such as rotation, shifting, zooming, and others to enhance the training dataset in order to enhance model generalization.
